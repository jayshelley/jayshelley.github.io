            </ul>
          <p>Because we won’t have an administrative office after the split, we could put ⅓ of the administrative offices in some unused rooms in a school that has had a declining student population, and do that at three different schools. This would:</p>  
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
              <li>Utilize the buildings we already have, and eliminate the problem of where should we house the administrators</li>

              <p>Unfortunately, there’s been a trend in schools of parents becoming critical and scrutinizing teachers, and teachers requesting to have less parental involvement in classrooms. This results in parents not understanding how to best help their children at home, and not having firsthand experience seeing the incredibly difficult job teachers do.</p>
              <p>It further results in lower test scores and increased costs, which leads to increased class sizes and hiring more teacher aides.</p>
              <p>Students benefit most when they have the support of both teachers and parents. Parents can better provide support when they are able to observe classes and be directly involved both at home and at school. Teachers do best when students and parents are both involved in the classroom and care about what’s best for all.</p>

            <p>Because Alpine is one of the largest school districts in the country there were financial benefits of scale for administrative costs. When we split we will lose the administrative financial benefits of scale, and will need to be cognizant to operate efficiently to prevent expenses that directly impact students’ education.</p>
            <p>We have three important decisions to make that will directly impact the trajectory of financial responsibility in our new district:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">

                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>These decisions will determine taxes for all our residents, both those with children attending school, and those who don’t have children in public schools.</p>

            <p>Principals know. For example, our children are in the Chinese immersion program and I’ve asked the Junior High Principal for details regarding students’ how many students stick with the program after elementary school, and about students’ performance on the AP Chinese Exam. The principal shared a large amount of data with me, which was very effective in helping our children determine how they wanted to proceed in the program. Additionally our Principal knew which teachers were able to take a class of struggling post-covid students and meet them where they were – at about half a grade behind – and helped them get half a grade ahead, all within a single year. They know the educational outcomes so why don’t parents?</p>
            <p>We need to recognize and reward teachers who are this amazing, and we ought to be much more transparent with how we are doing at educating.</p>
            <p>I believe we have a responsibility to be transparent not only financially, but also with the results achieved, and we should recognize teachers who are so amazing. <strong>When our new district is established on a foundation of transparency and driven to help students achieve, we’ll naturally attract the best teachers and administrators who are happy to be recognized for their amazing contributions.</strong></p>

            <p>Our children are our future -  they will be our doctors and lawyers, our electricians and plumbers. Their education and excitement for learning is critical to our collective future. Unfortunately, when I ask children what their favorite subjects are in school it’s uncommon that I find anyone who mentions a core academic subject. All too frequently I hear jokes or comments like: “Schools are made of bricks, and prisons are made of bricks” (followed by a look that says, don’t you see they’re the same) - what a shame! We can, and must, do better for our children.</p>
            <p>I believe in a future where children are excited to attend school, and excited to learn! This isn’t rocket science. The surveys Alpine has done through the years need to be more than lip-service and fake listening. Students have amazing ideas and contribute to the direction of our schools, but currently ASD has primarily listened only to the State and those who sue. We haven’t even gotten to really collaborating with parents in an effective way, and really we should be going past just parents and also involve the students in a much larger way than I’ve ever seen in public education.</p>
            <p><strong>We ought to listen to our children to create an environment where they want to learn, rather than obligatory learning.</strong></p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: I’m running for School Board because PTA members, from my time as PTA Treasurer, urged me to step up because they believe I could make a meaningful impact. Before registering, I reached out to two of the three other candidates and asked, “What are two things you think Alpine School District did well that we should keep, and two things we can improve as we start our new district?”</p> <!-- Answer -->
              <p>Their responses left me underwhelmed—most candidates seemed uninterested in real change or seizing the incredible opportunity we have starting a new district. That confirmed my decision to run. If the community wants me to help shape our new district, I’m happy to serve. However, if voters prefer the status quo, I have other things I’d love to do with my time and our family feels like we’re navigating schools well for our children.</p>

                <li>Public & Private education school experiences. Half of our children are in public school, and half are in private school. I've been surprised to realize that the things that makes private school compelling for most people have nothing to do with finances, it has everything to do with policies and mission; these are absolutely things public school can do but public schools need to value doing what's best for students as if their funding depends on it. Currently far too much of what I see in public schools are attitudes and actions nearly identical to when a business has a monopoly. I don't blame the people in public education, it's about incentives when working for a government entity. It won't be easy to change, but I think it's absolutely possible through structuring incentives differently in our new district.</li>
                <li>From talking with the other candidates I don't feel like others see innovative opportunities. I believe they're likely to continue operating nearly identical to how Alpine operated. I'd like to see a very significant increase in transparency and accountability, along with involving the community and students in coming up with more creative ideas to difficult problems, rather than simply thinking linearly and spending more money. Creativity loves constraints, and unfortunately most people do not spend enough mental effort or spend the time to creatively collaborate. If you think more money is the solution, you haven't identified the problem.</li>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: Our schools must support parents in their sacred role of educating their children, and our new school district must prioritize this partnership by empowering families, not sidelining them, in the educational process. Children are our future, and they deserve to love learning. Too often, schools stifle students’ natural curiosity. Our district should not only actively listen to parents and involve them as much as possible but also take student feedback to heart. I envision students contributing to teacher hiring and evaluating new course materials. True engagement of parents and students requires unwavering transparency. I’ve noticed a troubling trend of parents overly scrutinizing teachers and teachers pushing parents out of classrooms and volunteer roles—a dynamic I want to reverse. When teachers and parents collaborate with the student’s best interests at heart, we achieve the strongest learning outcomes.</p> <!-- Answer -->

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: Over the next decade, as enrollment declines and school choice options expand, managing finances will be critical. That said, I’m confident we can make it work. I spent three hours with Jason Sundberg at my home, diving into the details of Prop 2’s numbers during the vote. While I recognize the challenge, I believe we must think creatively about solutions rather than relying solely on linear approaches.</p>
              <p>Beyond enrollment and finances, building our new district brings other hurdles, like recruiting and retaining top teachers. With the district split, teachers will have more nearby districts to choose from. We must make our district a stable, attractive employer to keep the best educators.</p>
              <p>Inevitably, we’ll face legal battles, political obstacles, and public confidence issues, especially in the early years. By addressing these challenges with transparency and collaboration, I believe we will be able to build a great new school district.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: I love tackling difficult problems by thinking creatively and exploring all possibilities. Often, we can solve one issue by addressing another. For instance, I believe we can reduce school closures, cut costs, and ensure our new district’s administrators stay connected to daily classroom realities, all with one simple solution:</p>
              <p>Since we won’t have a dedicated administrative building—it’s in American Fork—we could place about a third of our administrators in unused classrooms in a school facing potential closure, then do the same in two other buildings. This approach maximizes existing space, eliminates the need for a separate administrative office, and brings administrators closer to students. Imagine the financial savings and non-financial benefits, like fostering a deeper understanding of classroom dynamics. By embedding administrators in schools, where they work alongside and listen to students, parents, and teachers, we reduce the risk of out-of-touch administrative decisions.</p>
              <p>That said, some school closures may be necessary. When they occur, we must involve the community as much as possible, collaborating to ensure decisions benefit not only our schools but also our neighborhoods and broader community.</p>

          <p class="font-bold">Q: What ideas do you have to encourage those who have left public education for alternatives to come back? <a class="show-more-less" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Show more</a></p> <!-- Question -->
            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: 
                <p>When I originally answered this question I assumed this was talking about teachers who have left public education. In hindsight I believe this is actually more focused on students. We are that family because we have half of our children in public schools and half in private schools. I'd really like to outcompete the private schools. Public schools have many advantages, like: </p>
                  <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                    <li>some of the most amazing teachers that we really miss</li>
                    <li>free to attend</li>
                    <li>closer to home</li>
                    <li>friends living nearby</li>
                    <li>sports programs are generally better</li>
                    <li>language immersion</li>
                  </ol>
                <p>We have to play to our advantages to make students and parents CHOOSE our public schools over the alternatives. In my opinion most of that comes down to good policies, especially related to:</p>
                  <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong> needs to be used to enhance the educational experience. Currently it's all too frequently used to make grading easier on teachers, at the expense of students' education.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curriculum</strong>: we need to trust teachers so they can teach what they love, rather than forcing curriculum on them that they aren't excited about.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teachers</strong> should be evaluated by students before hiring, and periodicly. One Principal I know would love to have one "free" fire each year, to prevent the red-tape they have to jump through.</li>
                    <li>Our <strong>Cell phone policy</strong>  can make a major difference in students engaging with classmates and teachers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Involving parents</strong> in major decisions. School counselors, teachers, administrators and parents should all work together for the good of students. No one trusted adult should take advantage of a situation to undermine other adults who are important in each student's education.</li>
                  </ol>
                <p>In addition to all these ideas, one of the top reasons we made a change was because it felt like we were having to augment the education our kids were receiving as soon as they got home through music, sports, homework, and tutoring which left no time for our family to do other things that mattered. Students should come back from school as better members of our families, rather than needing significant decompressing from an extremely anxiety-inducing day at school.</p>
                <p>While I haven’t fully explored this issue and I’m not yet certain it’s a top priority, my approach would mirror how I’ve tackled challenges in businesses: listen deeply and find creative solutions. I’d reach out to former educators who left for early retirement, private schools, charter schools, or homeschooling and ask them to share their stories. By asking thoughtful questions, I’d uncover the root reasons for their departure, especially non-monetary factors, as people often cite money when deeper issues—like feeling valued or heard—are at play. After gathering these insights, I’d reflect on them, often finding clarity during everyday moments like gardening or washing dishes. Solving complex problems isn’t about sitting in an office—it’s about listening closely to people, thinking deeply, and letting ideas emerge naturally.

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: To encourage families and educators who have left public education for alternatives to return, I’d tap into the power of community involvement and genuine listening. Some of the best teachers I’ve known were adjunct faculty or volunteers. I’d love to invite skilled community members—retirees, parents, or professionals—to contribute by teaching classes, mentoring, or reading with struggling students. There are countless ways to engage our community’s talent and passion.</p>

              <p>A: I will advocate for publishing not only the required detailed financial statements, but also establishing robust reporting on learning outcomes from the outset of our new school district. By prioritizing comprehensive transparency from day one—sharing more data than has been typical in the past—we can set a strong precedent. It will be difficult for future administrators to reduce transparent reporting without sparking community concern. This approach, rooted in the belief that sunlight is the best disinfectant, ensures our community stays well-informed and engaged, fostering trust and accountability in our schools.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: This is a great question! I strongly value diversity of thought as the foundation for innovative solutions, but I also recognize the need for consensus and compromise to move forward effectively. The best approach involves two phases. First, a divergent thinking phase where all ideas are welcomed, no matter how unconventional, and everyone feels safe to share without fear of judgment or dismissal. This creates a space for creative, bold solutions to emerge.</p>
              <p>Then, we transition to a convergent phase, where we carefully evaluate ideas to identify the most promising ones. This involves scrutinizing proposals, prioritizing those worth exploring through experiments or further research, and collaboratively refining them. I’ve taught this process at DevMountain and in various companies and groups to foster productive collaboration while avoiding groupthink. By balancing open ideation with focused decision-making, we can harness diverse perspectives to build consensus that serves our students and community.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: Books in School Libraries:</p>
              <p>School libraries should provide age-appropriate materials tailored to students’ needs. Not every book needs to be included in a school library, and if a student wants a book that’s unavailable, they can access it through the public library. For books with sensitive topics that are deemed appropriate for school libraries, I propose keeping them behind the librarian’s desk. This ensures they are not chosen accidentally but can still be accessed by students who intentionally seek them out.</p>
              <p>Religious Beliefs:</p>
              <p>Everyone should have the freedom to worship as they choose. Just as schools should not impose religious beliefs on students, they should also avoid pushing diversity initiatives in a way that feels coercive. I’m encouraged by Utah schools’ growing focus on safety, implemented in practical and effective ways, which supports a respectful and inclusive environment for all students.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: We shouldn't spend money we don't have, and we need to be wise in spending because such a large portion of taxes is for education. At the end of the day it's the lack of fiscal discipline that results in increased taxes for all of us. With that said, our children's education is extremely important and so is rewarding teachers for the incredible work they do.</p>
              <p>While I was the PTA Treasurer when we gave out Teacher Grants initially my committee was impressed with the great things teachers were buying to help in their classrooms, but upon further inspection, many teachers didn't realize we had those same supplies in the school louge for the teachers to use. I believe the same goes for any budget -- people oftentimes don't know they have access to other things and no one scrutinizes the purchasing, but we can and will review purchasing.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: Balancing low taxes, addressing building issues, and maintaining small class and school sizes requires creative and careful solutions. As I’ve noted before, complex problems often have straightforward answers. One idea is to place administrative offices in schools with extra capacity, reducing the need for separate facilities while preserving school buildings and keeping class sizes manageable.</p>
              <p>I will treat taxpayer money with the same care I apply to my own, scrutinizing every expense and seeking cost-effective alternatives. In addressing building issues, I’ve learned that contractors often inflate estimates when plans are vague, but detailed and complete plans can yield significant savings by reducing uncertainty for contractors. I will proactively engage with contractors to understand how our district can streamline processes, save time, and cut costs, ensuring we maximize value while maintaining quality education environments.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: I’m a strong supporter of specialized programs like Special Education (Sped), Advanced Learning Labs (ALL), and Dual Language Immersion (DLI). Each child is unique in their needs and superpowers. My wife and I have children who are all over the board from advanced and needing faster paced learning, to needing some accommodations.</p>
              <p>Our five children have thrived in Chinese Dual Language Immersion, which has been an incredible experience for our family, enriching their education and cultural understanding. We’ve also worked with a speech pathologist and completed ALL testing, giving me firsthand insight into the value of tailored educational support. We've had one advanced kid and one who has superpowers and learning to harness them. One of our friends had such an incredibly difficult time with a kid who is so obviously on the spectrum because ASD took 3 years to agree to an IEP - that can't be happening!</p>
              <p>I believe these programs are vital for meeting diverse student needs. Often, students who face the greatest challenges in school have the highest potential to become future leaders. Our new district must prioritize providing every student with the resources and support they need to succeed.</p>

          <p class="font-bold">Q: Describe how you would provide quality education for a diverse student population: i.e. the gifted and talented, the standard student, special education, the academically challenged, English as a Second Language (ESL) and cultural differences. <a class="show-more-less" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Show more</a></p> <!-- Question -->
            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: I care a lot about this. We have a child who is on the spectrum, we have a child who tested at the 15th grade level in math and 17th in reading while in 5th grade, and all of our childen are in the Chinese Immersion program. Some of our children more closely fit the mold of a "standard student." We have ESL students as neighbors who we care a lot about.</p>
              <p>Each child is so unique, and education ought to accommodate and meet each child where they are. How do we do this? Let's start with the baseline of what we currently have with ASD - I believe many things have gone fairly well and ASD has cared, but the areas I see for significant improvement are:</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                <li>It's far too difficult to get an IEP today for many students. I know of some who have spent years working with ASD and after a massive amount of struggle they've finally gotten and IEP when their child's case is about as obvious as it gets. It's SO hard on families with the district fights against the parents in getting their students' the help they need. This ought to be much more collaborative.</li>
                <li>How come my student's teachers didn't have any sense that our child was completely bored in school, or that he was FAR ahead? How come he was asked for 3 years to help teach everyone else in class and help with their math? This is awesome that teachers are employing the children to help others, but 3 years of this is far too much. We're underserving children who excel, and this is a shame. Educators know very well that children who are bored in school and never have to do homework because it's so easy struggle severely in college because their work ethic is not developed. We can and should identify cases where students are bored. This isn't hard to do, but takes a little effort.</li>
                <li>I understand that teachers can't suggest to parents when they suspect a child is on the spectrum, but I believe there's more we can do, even without an IEP, to help accommodate those who struggle with executive functioning and we don't have to wait until after they fail.</li>
                <li>I'm sure there's plenty more we can do and I will absolutely encourage more individualized education, but also in fiscally responsible ways.</li>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: I don't think schools will ever feel adequately funded, and comparing to other states, we're less funded.</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                <li>Creativity loves constraints and I don't believe the answer to all problems is more funding. I realize this is very idealistic to say. We have a larger K-12 population than most states, and we also have a lower income earning tax base than many states, so we need to be careful in raising funds responsibly.</li>
                <li>We can increase outcomes without increasing funding if we're creative. For example, my neighbor is retired and has helped children with their reading at the school every week, but our school has decided to terminate that program with volunteers. Additionally, my favorite teachers have been unpaid adjunct faculty who care about their subject matter and want to give back. I believe there's lots of opportunities to increase educational experiences like this without increasing funding. Theoretically if we were able to recruit volunteer experts in their fields to teach a class or two, there would be more funds to increase pay for the teachers we have.</li>
                <li>I'm not currently in the know on what can be done, but I'd support merit-based bonuses or pay options for the best teachers. This would have to be done very carefully because teachers know that a huge amount of excellent learning outcomes happen when teachers are assisted by involved parents at home helping their children, so we don't want to encourage a situation where teachers want all the best students/homes.</li>
                <li>I'm sure there's plenty more we can do and I will absolutely encourage more individualized education, but also in fiscally responsible ways.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I have a history of supporting teachers in our school by creative means and will absolutel champion means to help teachers as best we can. I'm not yet involved in the details enough to know what can be done, but maybe there's some emergent opportunities that will arise and I'm excited to help find them, while collaborating with others to do the best we can for our teachers.</p>

            <div class="expandable-content"> <!-- Hidden additional content -->
              <p>A: </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                <li><strong>EXCITEMENT FOR LEARNING:</strong> How excited are our children to learn? Our children are our
future - they will be our doctors and lawyers, our electricians and plumbers. Their education
and excitement for learning is critical to our collective future. Unfortunately, when I ask
children what their favorite subjects are in school it’s uncommon that I find anyone who
mentions a core academic subject. All too frequently I hear jokes or comments like:
“Schools are made of bricks, and prisons are made of bricks” (followed by a look that says,
don’t you see they’re the same) - what a shame! We can, and must, do better for our
children.
<p>I believe in a future where children are excited to attend school, and excited to learn! This
isn’t rocket science. The surveys Alpine has done through the years need to be more than
lip-service and fake listening. Students have amazing ideas and contribute to the direction
of our schools, but currently ASD has primarily listened only to the State and those who sue.
We haven’t even gotten to really collaborating with parents in an effective way, and really we
should be going past just parents and also involve the students in a much larger way than
I’ve ever seen in public education.</p></li>
<li><strong>TRANSPARENCY:</strong> What results are we getting for the taxpayer money we’re spending?
Principals know. For example, our children are in the Chinese immersion program and I’ve
asked the Junior High Principal for details regarding students’ how many students stick with
the program after elementary school, and about students’ performance on the AP Chinese
Exam. The principal shared a large amount of data with me, which was very effective in
helping our children determine how they wanted to proceed in the program. Additionally, our
Principal knew which teachers were able to take a class of struggling post-covid students
and meet them where they were – at about half a grade behind – and helped them get half a
grade ahead, all within a single year. They know the educational outcomes so why don’t
parents?
<p>We need to recognize and reward teachers who are this amazing, and we ought to be much
more transparent with how we are doing at educating.
I believe we have a responsibility to be transparent not only financially, but also with the
results achieved, and we should recognize teachers who are so amazing. When our new
district is established on a foundation of transparency and driven to help students achieve,
we’ll naturally attract the best teachers and administrators who are happy to be recognized
for their amazing contributions.</p></li>
<li><strong>CREATIVE SOLUTIONS:</strong> Here's one example of a possible creative solution to a big
problem:
<p>We can keep more schools open, while reducing costs, and incentivize administrators to
understand first-hand the issues in our schools. Most everyone I’ve met agrees that we
want:</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                <li>Our new school district to be fiscally sound and not be constantly increasing taxes</li>
                <li>Keep our smaller community schools open and reduce school closures</li>
                <li>Administrators who listen to parents, teachers, and students</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Because we won’t have an administrative office after the split, we could put ⅓ of the district administrative offices in some unused rooms in a school that has had a declining student population, and do that at three different schools. This would:</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5"></ol>
                <li>Utilize the buildings we already have, and eliminate the problem of where should we house the administrators</li>
                <li>Help keep those in administration directly in touch with what’s going on in the schools rather than moving them to an office away from the what’s happening in the classrooms, which helps them see what's happening daily</li>
                <li>Saves our new district the cost associated with building offices and prevents tax increases.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Where most people see insurmountable problems, I look for creative solutions.</p>
